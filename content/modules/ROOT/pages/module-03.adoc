= Hot Plugging Resources

In this module, you will add a network interface (NIC) to a virtual machine. To do this, you will start with an existing VM that has a single NIC on the pod network. Using the OpenShift Virtualization console, you will modify the configuration of the VM to include an additional NIC on a new network. You complete the hot plug action by live-migrating the VM to another worker node.

== Adding a virtual disk to a running VM

[#nic]
== Adding a NIC to a running VM
In this lab, we will add a new network interface connection (NIC) to an existing VM.

[start=1]
. Login to the OpenShift console using the credentials provided to you by the lab administrator. Navigate to Virtualization -> Virtual Machines, and select the virtualmachines project. Select the VM named vm01.

[start=2]
. Take note of the worker node on which the VM is running (worker-cluster-s67qr-1)

[start=3]
. Click on the Configuration tab and select Network. Note that the VM currently has a single NIC.

[start=4]
. Back in the Network configuration screen, click on the button “Add network interface”. Provide a name for the new interface, such as nic-1. The model should be virtio, and the Network should be default/east-west-nad. 
Click on the Save button.

[start=5]
. Click on the “>” symbol next to the “Pending changes” banner that has appeared below the VM name and note that the message indicates a restart or migration is required for the NIC addition to take effect.

[start=6]
. Although it is possible at this time to simply restart the VM, we are trying to hot plug the NIC, so instead we will initiate a  live migration. During a live migration, the VM will move from one worker node to another while the VM is still running.

[start=7]
. Follow the steps from Module 1 to live migrate the VM from one node to any other worker node. Once the migration has completed, continue with this module.

[start=8]
. Navigate back to the Console tab and you may see messages have appeared on the VM console that new hardware has been added. You can view the new NIC from the operating system by running the command ip address and viewing the output.
